            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>After completing high school, I pursued a degree in Engineering with a specialization in Electronics and Instrumentation. During my studies, I gained foundational knowledge in automation, which I applied to various academic projects. This hands-on experience sparked my interest in technology and problem-solving.

Upon graduating, I began my professional journey with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Early on, I decided to shift my focus toward software development, a field that aligns with my passion for building impactful solutions. My journey started with iOS mobile application development, where I honed my skills in creating user-friendly and efficient apps.

As my career progressed, I transitioned to hybrid application development, leveraging technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, Python Flask, Highcharts, and Bootstrap. These tools have allowed me to deliver robust and scalable applications tailored to diverse business needs.

In addition to front-end and full-stack development, I have developed strong expertise in DevOps practices and cloud computing with Microsoft Azure. I have worked extensively on automating deployment pipelines, managing cloud infrastructure, and ensuring seamless CI/CD workflows. This combination of development and operational skills has enabled me to build and maintain high-performing, scalable applications in dynamic environments.

With a versatile technical background and a proactive learning approach, I continue to seek opportunities to innovate, solve complex challenges, and contribute to impactful projects.

                     like preferred name/first name, last name, phone number type (Mobile/ Office/ VOIP/ Home) along
                     with their office location they are from on phone screen during incoming call, outgoing call and

                     these details and developing software to fetch these details from this database during phone calls.
                     This will help client know caller details even if their phone numbers are not saved in phonebook.
                     Also they can identify important incoming calls and calls on wait based on the caller details
                     displayed on screen and avoid missing such calls. These are very important features as Blackberry
