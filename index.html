          <h2>About Me</h2>

          <p>
            After completing high school, I pursued a degree in Engineering with
            a specialization in Electronics and Instrumentation. During my
            studies, I gained foundational knowledge in automation, which I
            applied to various academic projects. This hands-on experience
            sparked my interest in technology and problem-solving. Upon
            graduating, I began my professional journey with Tata Consultancy
            Services (TCS). Early on, I decided to shift my focus toward
            software development, a field that aligns with my passion for
            building impactful solutions. My journey started with iOS mobile
            application development, where I honed my skills in creating
            user-friendly and efficient apps. <br />
            As my career progressed, I transitioned to hybrid application
            development, leveraging technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript,
            AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, Python Flask, Highcharts, and Bootstrap.
            These tools have allowed me to deliver robust and scalable
            applications tailored to diverse business needs. <br />
            In addition to front-end and full-stack development, I have
            developed strong expertise in DevOps practices and cloud computing
            with Microsoft Azure. I have worked extensively on automating
            deployment pipelines, managing cloud infrastructure, and ensuring
            seamless CI/CD workflows. This combination of development and
            operational skills has enabled me to build and maintain
            high-performing, scalable applications in dynamic environments.
            <br />
            With a versatile technical background and a proactive learning
            approach, I continue to seek opportunities to innovate, solve
            complex challenges, and contribute to impactful projects.

                Firm Directory is an existing application developed by client
                for blackberry phones to hold details of all the associates in
                Client organization and acts as a firm wide directory to find
                people and their contact details. The project is to analyse this
                application and then design and develop a similar application
                named Caller ID that will run on blackberry phones to display
                caller details like preferred name/first name, last name, phone
                number type (Mobile/ Office/ VOIP/ Home) along with their office
                location they are from on phone screen during incoming call,
                outgoing call and call on wait. This involves creating a new
                database to hold all firm wide phone numbers along with these
                details and developing software to fetch these details from this
                database during phone calls. This will help client know caller
                details even if their phone numbers are not saved in phonebook.
                Also they can identify important incoming calls and calls on
                wait based on the caller details displayed on screen and avoid
                missing such calls. These are very important features as
                Blackberry phones are used for business purpose. <br />In
                future, this application will be enhanced with new as well as
                existing features from Firm Directory application such as people
                search, direct dialling from application, personalized settings,
                caller tunes, etc. so that the latter can be retired saving cost
                of maintaining 2 similar applications.

                The purpose of this project was to study third party credit card
                system and then design a model for assessing various third
                parties on basis of risk factors and compliance. TCS developed
                an application to enter new third parties, track various stages
                of their assessment, evaluate risk factors and compliance,
                approve/ reject third party based on assessment. Customers use
                this application to assess various third parties and determine
                whether they can make joint venture in offering credit cards
                thru those third parties.

                The purpose of this project was to analyse Client’s Marketing
                Media Mix Decision Support Tool that can be used for product
                pricing, determine impact on revenue, volume, margin, investment
                and gross profit, perform product comparison, simulate short
                term and long term investments on various marketing media
                channels like TV, radio, display boards, Facebook, etc. Based on
                this analysis, TCS designed and developed an iPAD application
                that can help Customer make various pricing and marketing
                investment simulations. These simulations can be saved on iPAD
                device for showcasing them to higher management that can help
                them arrive at important business decisions to maximize profit
                and optimize marketing investment expenses.
